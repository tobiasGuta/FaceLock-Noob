# FaceLock-Noob
**Face-Recon-Noob** is an accessible, entry-level Python tool designed for binary face recognition. It combines robust deep learning models with a straightforward Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify a single target person.

It works by:

1.  **Detection & Embedding:** Using a pre-trained **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** to detect a face and extract its unique **128-dimensional embedding vector**.

2.  **Classification:** Training an **SVM** on positive (target) and negative (other) embeddings to create a decision boundary.

3.  **Identification:** Classifying a new face as either **'MATCH'** or **'NO MATCH'** based on the confidence score generated by the SVM.

It's an ideal starting project for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of modern face verification using embeddings and classic machine learning.
